A calculator for dates.

## Motivation
Sometimes I would find myself searching the web to find an online tool to see how many days were passed since my anniversary, or what date it is 100 days later.
So the idea of using an offline date calculator emerged.

## Features
* Calculate the number of days since/until a specified date.
* Calculate the number of days between two specified dates.
* Show the date of x days ago/later specified by user.
* Show the date of x days before/after a date specified by user.

## Development Status
* So far only the code of the main programme has be completed. I'm yet to write setup.py to package my code.

## License
* This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 - see the LICENSE file for details.
